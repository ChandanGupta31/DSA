What is hashing =>  Hashing is something like pre-storing and fetching data.

E.g. Given an array and told to find the occurrence of each number so doing loop for each element take much time. That where hashing comes in the concept.
By hashing we can store the frequency of each element and whenever it needs we just fetch it.

=> If the size or value is greater than 1e+6 then use map or unordered map. Always prefer to use unordered map if it fails then use map.

=> When we use map it will take log n in storing and fetching data in all cases ( best, average, worst).
=> When we use unordered map it will take O(1) in best and average but in some cases it will take O(n) where n is the no of element in unordered map, this happens because of internal collision.
