Type of Graph -> Directed and Undirected.
In Directed graph all the edges are Directed.

Nodes/Vertex -> Represented by number
Edge -> branch between two nodes.

Cycles in a Graph-> Start from a node and end at that node
Path -> Contain a lot of vertices and each of them are reachable
     -> A node can not appear twice in a path.
Degree in Graph -> total no of edges coming or going in/from that node.

Total Degree of a graph  = 2*no of the edges

Directed Graph -> Indegree(node) -> no of incoming edges.
               -> Outdegree(node) -> no of outgoing edges.

Edge Weight -> if the weight is not assign we took unit weight.
