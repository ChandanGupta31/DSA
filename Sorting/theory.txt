Selection Sort => Find the Minimum and swap it.
In selection sort we find the minimum of the element and swap with the starting element and so on.
Time Complexity => O(n2).

Bubble Sort => Swap the two adjacent element(greater one at the last).
In bubble sort we just compare the two adjacent element and swap the greater one to the end.
Time Complexity => O(n2), but the best time Complexity is O(n).

Insertion Sort => Place the element at its right position.
In insertion sort it always take an element and place it in its correct position.
Time Complexity => O(n2).

Merge Sort => Algorithm is 'divide and merge'. 
Divide the given array into 2 half, until  the size of the array is 1 and then start merging them in sorted order.
Time Complexity => O(n log n).
